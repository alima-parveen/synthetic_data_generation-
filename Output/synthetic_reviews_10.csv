2,"""Macro Greens Powder Falls Short""","I was disappointed with the MacroLife Naturals Macro Greens Powder. Despite its impressive list of ingredients, I experienced stomach discomfort and bloating after consuming it. The taste was also unpleasantly grassy and earthy. I followed the instructions and started with a small dose, but unfortunately, the issues persisted. The product also didn't provide the energy boost I was expecting. Considering the price and the negative side effects, I wouldn't recommend this product to others.",B008MOPBZA,B008MOPBZA,user_7010,2024-07-13 12:31:12.729549,91,True,2024-08-24,12:31:12
2,"""Not Worth the Money and Side Effects""","I'm extremely disappointed with GNC Quercetin 500mg. I took it for a month, expecting improved immune function and allergy relief, but it did nothing for me. The capsules were huge and hard to swallow, and I experienced stomach discomfort and nausea after taking them. The price is also too high for the quality. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone, and I'm switching to a different brand.",B085GJR773,B085GJR773,user_5515,2024-08-04 12:31:15.372741,29,True,2024-05-29,12:31:15
5,"""Boosts Energy and Brain Function""","I've been taking Nutricost Pregnenolone for a month now and I'm impressed. This supplement has significantly improved my energy levels and mental clarity. I feel more focused and alert throughout the day. My mood has also improved, and I've noticed a reduction in stress and anxiety. The capsules are easy to swallow, and I appreciate that they're non-GMO, gluten-free, and vegetarian. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to others.",B09CDZR7WB,B09CDZR7WB,user_6071,2023-10-10 12:31:18.162691,45,False,2024-01-21,12:31:18
3,"""Arva 7-Chakra Star: A Mixed Blessing for Reiki Enthusiasts""","I'm torn about the Arva 7-Chakra Star Merkaba Crystal Quartz. On one hand, its large size and beautiful amethyst color make it a stunning piece for Reiki and crystal therapy. The Merkaba shape feels balanced and comfortable to hold. However, the crystal quality could be better, and it doesn't radiate the intense energy I expected. For the price, I hoped for a more potent healing tool. Still, it's a lovely addition to my collection.",B08217BCKV,B08217BCKV,user_1331,2024-08-12 12:31:20.981567,11,False,2024-06-09,12:31:20
3,"""Bakson B23 Drops - A Hit or Miss Affair""","I'm divided about Bakson Homeopathic B23 Drops for Skin. On one hand, it has helped reduce my acne and hyperpigmentation issues to some extent. However, the results were slow to appear and not as dramatic as I had hoped. The product is also quite pricey, and the dropper bottle can be tricky to use. Overall, it's an average product that may work for some, but not a game-changer for me.",B085DLXM2R,B085DLXM2R,user_4582,2023-10-07 12:31:23.662761,66,True,2024-03-01,12:31:23
3,"""Portable but Leaks Occasionally""","I purchased the Uriwell Unisex Personal Toilet for my elderly mother and it's been a mixed bag. On the plus side, it's lightweight, compact, and easy to use, making it perfect for travel or emergencies. However, I've noticed that it leaks occasionally, which can be messy and frustrating. Despite this issue, it's still a useful product, but I wish the manufacturer would improve the seal to prevent accidents.",B01F1GL81M,B01F1GL81M,user_7105,2024-03-18 12:31:26.323693,81,False,2024-07-23,12:31:26
2,"""Disappointing Electrolyte Hydration Powder Experience""","I was excited to try Fasting Water Electrolyte Hydration Powder, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. The powder had a strong, unpleasant taste that was hard to mask, even with flavored water. After consuming it, I experienced bloating and stomach discomfort that lasted for hours. I also noticed that the product didn't provide the promised hydration benefits. For the price, I expected better quality and results.",B084SP8CR6,B084SP8CR6,user_9374,2023-10-12 12:31:29.038342,32,False,2024-05-17,12:31:29
3,"""Cotton Castor Oil Pack, A Mixed Bag""","The Castor Oil Pack is a convenient and mess-free solution for those looking to incorporate castor oil into their wellness routine. The cotton holder is soft and comfortable against the skin. However, the quality of the stitching could be improved, as it starts to unravel after a few uses. Additionally, the pack's adhesive loses its stickiness over time. Overall, it's an okay product that could benefit from some design tweaks.",B0B6ZNXDHR,B0B6ZNXDHR,user_4813,2024-06-19 12:31:31.798771,40,False,2023-10-10,12:31:31
1,'Noni Liquids Falls Short on Promises',"I was really looking forward to trying Noni Liquids, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. The taste was extremely bitter and unpleasant, making it difficult to consume daily. I also experienced stomach cramps and diarrhea after a few days of taking it. The product claims to be 100% natural, but I'm not convinced. The packaging was also flimsy, and one of the bottles leaked during shipping. Definitely not worth the money.",B0C8RYJBB3,B0C8RYJBB3,user_3185,2024-04-06 12:31:34.595024,61,False,2024-03-24,12:31:34
